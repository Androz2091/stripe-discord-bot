# Stripe Discord Bot

This Stripe Discord bot is useful to put a Discord server behind a paywall. It makes direct requests to Stripe, meaning there is no other fees (like when using Donatebot.io) to manage roles. Users have to provide their email using /email and they get instant access. There is a daily check to make sure their subscriptions are still active.

## [Sublyna](https://sublyna.com)

This Stripe Discord Bot will remain **free and open source**. However, hosting and configuring it can be challenging for beginners, and issues may arise if you're not familiar with the setup. Since I receive a lot of questions that I can't always answer individually, I recommend using [Sublyna](https://sublyna.com) â€” a new service packed with features that lets you turn your community into a paid one in just a few clicks, with low fees.

## Installation

You can install and host this bot on your own server. Here are the main steps:

* Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v16 or higher.
* Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) v13 or higher.
* Create a new database and a new role that has access to the database.
* Install the dependencies of the project by running `yarn install`.
* Run `yarn build` to get the JavaScript output of the project.
* Install PM2 or another process manager to keep your bot alive, or run `yarn start`.
* You are done!
